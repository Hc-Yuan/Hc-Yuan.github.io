## Welcome to my homepage!

Here is another homepage [click here](fjallraven-hc.github.io) held by me for test. It is based on hexo and mainly composed of some blogs in diverse topics.

### Bio
I graduated from Tieyi middle school in Xi'an Shannxi Province.   
I am expected to receive a bachelor degree in computer science from Peking University in July, 2017.   
Honestly, i am in the gap year now, seeking for a satisfying program and school for graduate study.   
My personal research interests lay in `Natural Language Processing`, `Computer Vision` and `Advanced Algorithms`.

Whenever i commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme i have selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/Hc-Yuan/Hc-Yuan.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
